| [1-greeting-java](1-greeting-java/)           | Simple REST microservice (Maven Project) based on Spring Boot 2.4.2 and Java 11. 
| [2-hello-go](2-hello-go/)                     | Simple Go microservice used to demonstrate how to implement mutual TLS authentication.
| [3-caddy-sidecar](3-caddy-sidecar/)           | Caddy as sidecar proxy for any kind of microservice to manage MTLS and Certificates.
| [4-mtls-emojivoto-tf](4-mtls-emojivoto-tf)    | Example enabling MTLS on Buoyant [Emojivoto](https://github.com/buoyantio/emojivoto) microservices application using [SmallStep CA](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) and [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/). This version is based on [Step AWS Emojivoto](https://github.com/smallstep/step-aws-emojivoto) example and it's adapted to be used for multiple users simultaneously without collisions.
